================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Hardcoded sensitive data
Issue: The password file 'pwd.txt' path is hardcoded which could expose sensitive data if the system is compromised.
Solution: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data. You can use environment variables or secure vault services to store passwords.

Vulnerability: Insecure password comparison
Issue: The password is compared in plain text with common passwords. This exposes the risk of leaking passwords during the check.
Solution: Don't compare passwords in plain text. Instead, utilise a secure comparison method such as bcrypt.

Vulnerability: Insecure use of MessageBox
Issue: Sensitive information (password) is being displayed in MessageBox, risking exposure if screen is viewed by others.
Solution: Avoid displaying sensitive information directly to the user. If necessary, mask or censor the critical parts of the data.

Vulnerability: Unsecure data storage
Issue: Passwords are stored in plain text in file 'pwd.txt', any compromise of the storage may lead to data breach.
Solution: Passwords should be stored in a hashed or encrypted format using secure algorithm instead of plain text.

Vulnerability: Information leakage
Issue: Providing clear information that a password was found in the list of common passwords can hint attackers about the passwords used.
Solution: Avoid providing explicit feedback about how the password policy rules. Generic feedback should be given.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check password against common passwords
Details:
  TestName: test_password_in_common_passwords
  Description: This test verifies that when a common password is checked, the function will correctly display that the password is not unique.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a common password from the 'pwd.txt' file.
  Act: Invokes the 'check_password' function with the common password.
  Assert: Expect a message box to be displayed indicating that the password is not unique.
Validation:
  This test is important as it validates core functionality of the 'check_password' function, ensuring that common passwords are correctly identified.

Scenario 2: Check unique password
Details:
  TestName: test_check_unique_password
  Description: This test verifies that when a truly unique password is checked, the function correctly displays that the password is unique.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a truly unique password that is not present in the 'pwd.txt' file.
  Act: Invokes the check_password function with a unique password.
  Assert: Expect a message box to be displayed indicating that the password is unique.
Validation:
  This test is important as it validates the capability of the 'check_password' function to correctly identify unique passwords.

Scenario 3: Check password with special characters 
Details:
  TestName: test_check_password_with_special_characters
  Description: This test verifies that the function can correctly handle and check passwords that contain special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a password with special characters.
  Act: Invokes the 'check_password' function with the specially created password.
  Assert: Should return the appropriate unique or not unique message depending on the password created.
Validation:
  This is an important test as special characters are a common condition for establishing strong, unique passwords. This test ensures that the function can handle and verify such passwords correctly.

Scenario 4: Check empty password 
Details:
  TestName: test_check_empty_password
  Description: This test is to verify the function behavior when the provided password is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty string for password.
  Act: Invokes the 'check_password' function with the empty string.
  Assert: Expect a message box indicating that the password is not unique (assuming empty string is considered as a common password).
Validation:
  This is important as it checks the function behavior under edge cases, ensuring the function can handle such input. This contributes to the robustness of the function.

Scenario 5: Check password as a case-sensitive string 
Details:
  TestName: test_check_password_case_sensitive
  Description: This test is to verify the function behavior when the provided password is a case-sensitive string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a password from 'pwd.txt' file with few characters in uppercase.
  Act: Invokes the 'check_password' function with the case-sensitive password.
  Assert: Depending on the function design, expect a message box indicating that the password is unique or not unique.
Validation:
  This is important as it checks the function behavior under edge cases, ensuring the function can handle such input.
