================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The code reads from a file named 'pwd.txt' without validating the file path. An attacker could potentially manipulate the file path to read arbitrary files on the system.
Solution: Use os.path.abspath() or os.path.realpath() to get the absolute path of the intended file. Validate that the absolute path starts with the expected directory to prevent path traversal.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The code reads a file containing common passwords and compares them to the user-provided password. If the file is readable by unauthorized users, it could expose the list of common passwords.
Solution: Ensure the 'pwd.txt' file is stored in a secure location and has strict file permissions (e.g., readable only by the application user). Consider using a more secure method to store and compare the passwords, such as hashing.

Vulnerability: CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements
Issue: The code only checks if the provided password matches a list of common passwords. It does not enforce any other password strength requirements, such as minimum length, complexity, or uniqueness.
Solution: Implement additional password strength checks, such as requiring a minimum length, a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Consider using a library like 'password-strength' to evaluate password strength.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Password found in common passwords list
Details:
  TestName: test_check_password_common_password
  Description: This test verifies that the check_password function correctly identifies a password that exists in the common passwords list and displays the appropriate message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the "pwd.txt" file contains a list of common passwords, and the password to be tested is present in the list.
  Act: Call the check_password function with the common password as an argument.
  Assert: Verify that the messagebox.showinfo function is called with the expected message indicating that the password is not unique and its position in the list.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies common passwords and provides feedback to the user, promoting the use of unique passwords and enhancing security.

Scenario 2: Password not found in common passwords list
Details:
  TestName: test_check_password_unique_password
  Description: This test verifies that the check_password function correctly identifies a password that does not exist in the common passwords list and displays the appropriate message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the "pwd.txt" file contains a list of common passwords, and the password to be tested is not present in the list.
  Act: Call the check_password function with the unique password as an argument.
  Assert: Verify that the messagebox.showinfo function is called with the expected message indicating that the password is unique.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies unique passwords and provides positive feedback to the user, encouraging the use of strong and uncommon passwords.

Scenario 3: Empty password
Details:
  TestName: test_check_password_empty_password
  Description: This test verifies that the check_password function handles an empty password correctly and displays the appropriate message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the "pwd.txt" file contains a list of common passwords.
  Act: Call the check_password function with an empty string as the password argument.
  Assert: Verify that the messagebox.showinfo function is called with the expected message indicating that the password is unique.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles the edge case of an empty password correctly and provides consistent feedback to the user.

Scenario 4: Password file not found
Details:
  TestName: test_check_password_file_not_found
  Description: This test verifies that the check_password function handles the case when the "pwd.txt" file is not found and raises the appropriate exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the "pwd.txt" file does not exist in the specified location.
  Act: Call the check_password function with any password as an argument.
  Assert: Verify that a FileNotFoundError exception is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function gracefully handles the situation when the password file is missing and propagates the error appropriately for further handling.

Scenario 5: Password file is empty
Details:
  TestName: test_check_password_empty_file
  Description: This test verifies that the check_password function handles the case when the "pwd.txt" file is empty and displays the appropriate message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the "pwd.txt" file exists but is empty.
  Act: Call the check_password function with any password as an argument.
  Assert: Verify that the messagebox.showinfo function is called with the expected message indicating that the password is unique.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles the edge case of an empty password file correctly and provides consistent feedback to the user.
