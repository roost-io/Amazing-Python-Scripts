### Scenario 1: No Variables Defined or Used
Details:
  TestName: test_no_variables_in_tree
  Description: Verify that the function handles an empty AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) without any variables, ensuring no feedback is given about undefined variables.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty Python AST tree.
  Act: Call the _check_undefined_vars method with the empty AST tree.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list remains empty.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method correctly identifies the absence of variables and does not incorrectly flag errors in an empty code structure. It validates the method's ability to handle minimal input.

### Scenario 2: Variable Defined Before Use
Details:
  TestName: test_variable_defined_before_use
  Description: Test that when a variable is defined before it is used, the feedback list remains empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an AST tree where a variable is assigned before it is used.
  Act: Invoke the _check_undefined_vars method with this AST tree.
  Assert: Verify that the feedback list is empty.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's ability to understand the normal flow of variable definition and usage, ensuring it does not incorrectly identify legally defined variables as undefined.

### Scenario 3: Variable Used Without Definition
Details:
  TestName: test_variable_used_without_definition
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly identifies and reports variables that are used without being defined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree where a variable is used before any assignment.
  Act: Call the _check_undefined_vars method with this AST tree.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list contains an appropriate message about the undefined variable.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for validating the primary purpose of the function â€” to detect and report uses of undefined variables. It confirms the function's correctness and reliability in flagging potential errors in code.

### Scenario 4: Multiple Variables with Mixed Definitions
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_variables_mixed_definitions
  Description: Check that the function accurately handles cases with multiple variables where some are defined and others are not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an AST tree with multiple variables, some assigned before use and others not.
  Act: Use the _check_undefined_vars method on this tree.
  Assert: Ensure the feedback list correctly reflects only the variables that are undefined.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to discern between defined and undefined variables in complex code structures, which is essential for accurate feedback in real-world applications.

### Scenario 5: Redefinition and Multiple Uses of the Same Variable
Details:
  TestName: test_redefinition_and_multiple_uses_of_variable
  Description: Verify that the function handles cases where the same variable is defined multiple times and used multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree where a variable is defined, used, redefined, and used again.
  Act: Run the _check_undefined_vars method with this AST tree.
  Assert: Confirm that the feedback list is empty, indicating correct handling of variable scopes and redefinitions.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle variable scope appropriately and does not confuse redefinitions or multiple uses as undefined behavior. This capability is vital for accurate static analysis in dynamically scoped environments like Python.
