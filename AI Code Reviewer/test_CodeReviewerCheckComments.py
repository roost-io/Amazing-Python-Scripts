### Scenario 1: Test with a Properly Formatted Comment
Details:
  TestName: test_comment_with_proper_format
  Description: Verify that the function does not append feedback for a properly formatted comment (a comment that starts with '# ' followed by text).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a string of code containing a properly formatted comment.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the prepared code string.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list remains empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that comments which are correctly formatted according to the style guide do not generate unnecessary feedback, adhering to the function's purpose of identifying style issues.

### Scenario 2: Test with a Comment Missing Space After Hash
Details:
  TestName: test_comment_missing_space_after_hash
  Description: Ensure that the function appends the appropriate feedback for a comment that starts with a '#' but has no space following it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the class instance and prepare a string of code with a comment missing a space after the hash.
  Act: Invoke the _check_comments method with the code string.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list contains the expected message about improving comment style.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to detect and provide feedback on common comment styling mistakes, which is crucial for maintaining a uniform code style across a project.

### Scenario 3: Test with an Empty Comment
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_comment
  Description: Verify that the function appends feedback for a comment consisting only of the '#' character.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an instance of the class and prepare a string of code that includes an empty comment line.
  Act: Execute the _check_comments method using the prepared string.
  Assert: Ensure that the feedback list includes a message about the empty comment needing improvement.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's effectiveness in identifying completely empty comments, which are typically not useful and should either be removed or completed.

### Scenario 4: Test with Multiple Comment Issues
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_comment_issues
  Description: Check that the function handles multiple lines with various comment style issues correctly and appends feedback for each problematic comment.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a class instance and prepare a multi-line string where different lines have different comment issues (e.g., no space after '#', empty comments).
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with this multiline string.
  Assert: Validate that the feedback list contains a message for each comment issue identified.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function can handle and report multiple issues within a single input, critical for comprehensive code reviews and maintaining code quality.

### Scenario 5: Test with No Comments
Details:
  TestName: test_no_comments_in_code
  Description: Ensure that the function does not append any feedback when there are no comments in the provided code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the class and prepare a string of code without any comments.
  Act: Use the _check_comments method on this code.
  Assert: Confirm that the feedback list remains empty.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function only reacts to comment-related issues and remains silent when comments are absent, avoiding unnecessary feedback clutter.

### Scenario 6: Test Code with Mixed Content
Details:
  TestName: test_code_with_mixed_content
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies comment issues in a code string that also contains actual code (not just comments).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a class instance and a string of code that includes both executable lines and various styles of comments.
  Act: Invoke the _check_comments method with this string.
  Assert: Ensure that only the comment lines contribute to the feedback, ignoring the executable lines.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the functionâ€™s ability to discern comments from code and handle them appropriately, which is essential for real-world applications where comments and code are interspersed.
