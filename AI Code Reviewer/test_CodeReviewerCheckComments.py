Here are the test scenarios for the `_check_comments` method:

Scenario 1: Comment with proper spacing
Details:
  TestName: test_properly_formatted_comment
  Description: Verify that comments with proper spacing after the '#' symbol do not trigger any feedback.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, and prepare a code string with a properly formatted comment.
  Act: Call the `_check_comments` method with the prepared code string.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly identifies well-formatted comments and does not provide unnecessary feedback.

Scenario 2: Comment without spacing
Details:
  TestName: test_comment_without_spacing
  Description: Verify that comments without spacing after the '#' symbol trigger feedback.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, and prepare a code string with a comment without spacing.
  Act: Call the `_check_comments` method with the prepared code string.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should contain a feedback message indicating the issue with the comment.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly identifies comments without spacing and provides appropriate feedback.

Scenario 3: Empty comment
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_comment
  Description: Verify that empty comments (i.e., a line with only '#') trigger feedback.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, and prepare a code string with an empty comment.
  Act: Call the `_check_comments` method with the prepared code string.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should contain a feedback message indicating the issue with the comment.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly identifies empty comments and provides appropriate feedback.

Scenario 4: Multiple comments with issues
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_comments_with_issues
  Description: Verify that the method correctly handles multiple comments with issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, and prepare a code string with multiple comments, some with spacing and some without.
  Act: Call the `_check_comments` method with the prepared code string.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should contain feedback messages for each comment with issues.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle multiple comments and provide accurate feedback for each one.

Scenario 5: No comments
Details:
  TestName: test_no_comments
  Description: Verify that the method does not provide feedback when there are no comments in the code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, and prepare a code string without comments.
  Act: Call the `_check_comments` method with the prepared code string.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly handles code without comments and does not provide unnecessary feedback.

Scenario 6: Code with non-comment lines
Details:
  TestName: test_code_with_non_comment_lines
  Description: Verify that the method ignores non-comment lines and only checks comments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, and prepare a code string with both comment and non-comment lines.
  Act: Call the `_check_comments` method with the prepared code string.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should only contain feedback for comments with issues, ignoring non-comment lines.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly focuses on comments and ignores other code lines.

Scenario 7: Empty code string
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_code_string
  Description: Verify that the method can handle an empty code string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, and prepare an empty code string.
  Act: Call the `_check_comments` method with the prepared code string.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle edge cases like an empty code string and does not provide unnecessary feedback.
