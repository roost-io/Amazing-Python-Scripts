### Scenario 1: Test with a Properly Formatted Comment
Details:
  TestName: test_comment_with_proper_format
  Description: Verify that the function does not append feedback for a properly formatted comment (a space after the '#').
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object and prepare a string with a properly formatted comment.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list remains empty.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by confirming that well-formed comments are not flagged incorrectly, ensuring the function correctly identifies style issues without generating false positives.

### Scenario 2: Test with an Improperly Formatted Comment (no space)
Details:
  TestName: test_comment_without_space_after_hash
  Description: Ensure that the function appends appropriate feedback for a comment without a space after the '#'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object and prepare a string with a comment lacking a space after the '#'.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list contains the expected message regarding the improper comment format.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the function enforces styling rules by identifying comments that do not adhere to expected formatting standards, which is crucial for maintaining readability and consistency in code comments.

### Scenario 3: Test with an Empty Comment
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_comment
  Description: Validate that the function appends feedback for a comment that consists only of a '#'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object and prepare a string containing only a '#'.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list includes a message about the empty comment.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can identify and flag completely empty comments, which do not contribute to understanding the code and should either be expanded or removed.

### Scenario 4: Test with Multiple Comments, Including Both Correct and Incorrect Formats
Details:
  TestName: test_mixed_comment_styles
  Description: Check that the function correctly handles multiple comments in various styles within a single input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object and prepare a string with multiple comments, some correctly formatted and others not.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the feedback list only contains entries for the incorrectly formatted comments.
Validation:
  This scenario is important for ensuring that the function operates correctly in realistic scenarios where code may contain a mix of well-formed and poorly-formed comments.

### Scenario 5: Test with Non-Comment Code Present
Details:
  TestName: test_code_with_non_comment_lines
  Description: Ensure that the function does not append feedback for lines of code that are not comments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object and prepare a string that includes both comments and regular lines of code.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the prepared string.
  Assert: Confirm that only the comment lines are evaluated and feedback is correctly managed.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function discriminates between comment lines and code lines, focusing its evaluations only on comments, which is crucial for its intended purpose without affecting non-comment code lines.

### Scenario 6: Test with Comments Following Code on the Same Line
Details:
  TestName: test_inline_comments
  Description: Verify that the function handles inline comments correctly, even when they follow code on the same line.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object and prepare a string where comments are inline following some code.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the function does not erroneously flag these comments if they are formatted correctly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can accurately handle and evaluate inline comments, which are common in real-world code, without misidentifying them based on their placement.
