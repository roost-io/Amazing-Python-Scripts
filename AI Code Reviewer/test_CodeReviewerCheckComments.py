### Scenario 1: Test with a properly formatted comment
Details:
  TestName: test_properly_formatted_comment
  Description: Verify that the function does not append feedback for a properly formatted comment.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a string with a properly formatted comment.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list remains empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that comments that follow the expected standard (a hash followed by a space and then the comment text) are recognized as correctly formatted, adhering to common coding standards.

### Scenario 2: Test with a comment lacking space after the hash
Details:
  TestName: test_comment_without_space_after_hash
  Description: Verify that the function appends appropriate feedback for a comment that does not have a space after the hash.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a string with a comment that lacks a space after the hash.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list contains a specific message about improving comment style related to space.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to enforce style guidelines that require a space following the hash in comments, which is a common coding convention for readability.

### Scenario 3: Test with an empty comment (only hash)
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_comment
  Description: Verify that the function appends feedback for an empty comment consisting only of the hash symbol.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a string that contains a line with only a hash symbol.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list includes a specific message about the empty comment.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can identify and prompt the user to avoid using empty comments, which do not contribute to code understanding or documentation.

### Scenario 4: Test with multiple issues in comments
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_comment_issues
  Description: Verify that the function handles multiple lines of comments, including both correctly formatted and incorrectly formatted comments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a multiline string with both proper and improper comments.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the multiline string.
  Assert: Ensure that feedback is generated only for the improperly formatted comments.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness in handling a realistic codebase scenario where multiple styles of comments exist, ensuring that feedback is accurately targeted.

### Scenario 5: Test with no comments in the code
Details:
  TestName: test_no_comments_in_code
  Description: Verify that the function does not append any feedback when there are no comment lines in the provided code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a string of code without any comments.
  Act: Call the _check_comments method with the string.
  Assert: Check that the feedback list remains empty.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly identifies the absence of comments and does not mistakenly append feedback, which is crucial for avoiding false positives in a clean or comment-free codebase.
