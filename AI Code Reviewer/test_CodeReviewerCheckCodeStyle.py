Here are the test scenarios for the `_check_code_style` method:

Scenario 1: Code with no style issues
Details:
  TestName: test_no_style_issues
  Description: Verify that the method does not append any feedback when the code has no style issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class, prepare a code string with no style issues.
  Act: Call the `_check_code_style` method with the prepared code.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method does not report false positives, i.e., it only reports style issues when they are actually present.

Scenario 2: Code with style issues
Details:
  TestName: test_style_issues_found
  Description: Verify that the method appends feedback when the code has style issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class, prepare a code string with style issues.
  Act: Call the `_check_code_style` method with the prepared code.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should contain a message indicating code style issues.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly reports style issues when they are present in the code.

Scenario 3: Empty code string
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_code
  Description: Verify that the method does not append feedback when the code string is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class, prepare an empty code string.
  Act: Call the `_check_code_style` method with the prepared code.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method handles edge cases correctly, such as empty input.

Scenario 4: None input
Details:
  TestName: test_none_input
  Description: Verify that the method raises an error when the input code is None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class.
  Act: Call the `_check_code_style` method with None as the input code.
  Assert: A TypeError or ValueError should be raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly handles invalid input and raises an error accordingly.

Scenario 5: Non-string input
Details:
  TestName: test_non_string_input
  Description: Verify that the method raises an error when the input code is not a string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class.
  Act: Call the `_check_code_style` method with a non-string input (e.g., an integer or a list).
  Assert: A TypeError should be raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly handles invalid input and raises an error accordingly.

Note: These scenarios cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions for the `_check_code_style` method.
