### Scenario 1: No Code Style Issues
Details:
  TestName: test_check_code_style_no_issues
  Description: Tests if the method correctly identifies that there are no code style issues in the provided code snippet.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a code snippet that adheres to the PEP8 style guide.
  Act: Call the `_check_code_style` method with the compliant code snippet.
  Assert: Verify that the `feedback` list remains empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly identifies code snippets without style issues, which is crucial for not giving false positives and aligns with the expected functionality of the method.

### Scenario 2: Code Style Issues Present
Details:
  TestName: test_check_code_style_with_issues
  Description: Tests if the method identifies code style issues and appends an appropriate message to the feedback list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a code snippet that violates the PEP8 style guide.
  Act: Call the `_check_code_style` method with the non-compliant code snippet.
  Assert: Verify that the `feedback` list contains the specific message about code style issues.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's ability to detect style violations and provide feedback, which is essential for informing users of necessary corrections. The functionality directly supports the method's purpose to enforce coding standards.

### Scenario 3: Empty Code Input
Details:
  TestName: test_check_code_style_empty_code
  Description: Verify the method's behavior when an empty string is passed as code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Call the `_check_code_style` method with an empty string.
  Assert: Check that the `feedback` list remains empty.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the method's robustness in handling cases where no code is provided. Ensuring that no feedback is generated in such cases prevents confusion and unnecessary alerts, maintaining user trust in the feedback's relevance.

### Scenario 4: Multiple Errors in Code
Details:
  TestName: test_check_code_style_multiple_errors
  Description: Confirm that the method handles multiple style errors within a single code snippet effectively.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a code snippet with several distinct style violations.
  Act: Call the `_check_code_style` method with the problematic code.
  Assert: Verify that the `feedback` list contains a single message indicating the presence of code style issues.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle multiple errors efficiently without duplicating feedback messages. It is crucial for maintaining clear and concise feedback, which aids users in debugging processes.

### Scenario 5: Complex Code Input
Details:
  TestName: test_check_code_style_complex_code
  Description: Test the method's efficiency and correctness with a complex code snippet that includes various Python constructs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a complex code snippet potentially containing both compliant and non-compliant sections.
  Act: Call the `_check_code_style` method with the complex code.
  Assert: Verify that the `feedback` list is updated correctly according to the presence of style errors.
Validation:
  Testing with complex code ensures that the method is robust and effective across different real-world programming scenarios. This is critical for a tool intended to be used in diverse development environments and projects.
