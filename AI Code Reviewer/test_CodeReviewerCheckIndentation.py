Here are the test scenarios for the `_check_indentation` method:

**Scenario 1: Function with docstring**
Details:
  TestName: test_function_with_docstring
  Description: Verify that a function with a docstring does not trigger a feedback message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree with a function definition that includes a docstring.
  Act: Call `_check_indentation` with the AST tree as an argument.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that functions with docstrings are handled correctly and do not generate unnecessary feedback.

**Scenario 2: Function without docstring or pass statement**
Details:
  TestName: test_function_missing_docstring_and_pass
  Description: Verify that a function without a docstring or pass statement triggers a feedback message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree with a function definition that does not include a docstring or pass statement.
  Act: Call `_check_indentation` with the AST tree as an argument.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should contain a message indicating that a docstring or pass statement is missing.
Validation:
  This test ensures that functions without docstrings or pass statements are correctly identified and reported.

**Scenario 3: For loop with pass statement**
Details:
  TestName: test_for_loop_with_pass
  Description: Verify that a for loop with a pass statement does not trigger a feedback message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree with a for loop that includes a pass statement.
  Act: Call `_check_indentation` with the AST tree as an argument.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that loops with pass statements are handled correctly and do not generate unnecessary feedback.

**Scenario 4: For loop without pass statement**
Details:
  TestName: test_for_loop_without_pass
  Description: Verify that a for loop without a pass statement triggers a feedback message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree with a for loop that does not include a pass statement.
  Act: Call `_check_indentation` with the AST tree as an argument.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should contain a message indicating that a pass statement is missing.
Validation:
  This test ensures that loops without pass statements are correctly identified and reported.

**Scenario 5: While loop with pass statement**
Details:
  TestName: test_while_loop_with_pass
  Description: Verify that a while loop with a pass statement does not trigger a feedback message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree with a while loop that includes a pass statement.
  Act: Call `_check_indentation` with the AST tree as an argument.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that loops with pass statements are handled correctly and do not generate unnecessary feedback.

**Scenario 6: While loop without pass statement**
Details:
  TestName: test_while_loop_without_pass
  Description: Verify that a while loop without a pass statement triggers a feedback message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree with a while loop that does not include a pass statement.
  Act: Call `_check_indentation` with the AST tree as an argument.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should contain a message indicating that a pass statement is missing.
Validation:
  This test ensures that loops without pass statements are correctly identified and reported.

**Scenario 7: If statement with pass statement**
Details:
  TestName: test_if_statement_with_pass
  Description: Verify that an if statement with a pass statement does not trigger a feedback message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree with an if statement that includes a pass statement.
  Act: Call `_check_indentation` with the AST tree as an argument.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that conditional statements with pass statements are handled correctly and do not generate unnecessary feedback.

**Scenario 8: If statement without pass statement**
Details:
  TestName: test_if_statement_without_pass
  Description: Verify that an if statement without a pass statement triggers a feedback message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree with an if statement that does not include a pass statement.
  Act: Call `_check_indentation` with the AST tree as an argument.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should contain a message indicating that a pass statement is missing.
Validation:
  This test ensures that conditional statements without pass statements are correctly identified and reported.

**Scenario 9: With statement with pass statement**
Details:
  TestName: test_with_statement_with_pass
  Description: Verify that a with statement with a pass statement does not trigger a feedback message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree with a with statement that includes a pass statement.
  Act: Call `_check_indentation` with the AST tree as an argument.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should be empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that context managers with pass statements are handled correctly and do not generate unnecessary feedback.

**Scenario 10: With statement without pass statement**
Details:
  TestName: test_with_statement_without_pass
  Description: Verify that a with statement without a pass statement triggers a feedback message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an AST tree with a with statement that does not include a pass statement.
  Act: Call `_check_indentation` with the AST tree as an argument.
  Assert: The `feedback` list should contain a message indicating that a pass statement is missing.
Validation:
  This test ensures that context managers without pass statements are correctly identified and reported.
