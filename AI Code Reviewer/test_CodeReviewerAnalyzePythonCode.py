```
Scenario 1: Valid Python Code with Proper Style and Documentation
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_python_code
  Description: Verify that the function handles properly styled and documented Python code without any feedback.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string of Python code with correct indentation, defined variables, proper comments, and adherence to PEP8 style guide.
  Act: The analyze_python_code method is called with this string.
  Assert: The feedback list remains empty as there are no issues with the code.
Validation:
  Ensuring that well-formed and compliant code passes without errors or warnings is crucial for developer confidence and underscores the analyzer’s ability to discern correct coding practices.

Scenario 2: Python Code with Syntax Errors
Details:
  TestName: test_syntax_error_handling
  Description: Ensure that the function identifies syntax errors and appends appropriate feedback.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string of Python code with a deliberate syntax error.
  Act: The analyze_python_code method is called with this string.
  Assert: The feedback list contains a message about the syntax error.
Validation:
  Detecting syntax errors is fundamental for any code analysis tool. This test confirms that the function can catch and report such errors, which is essential for early debugging.

Scenario 3: Code with Indentation Issues
Details:
  TestName: test_indentation_error_detection
  Description: Test the function's ability to detect and report indentation errors in Python code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Python code string intentionally misindented.
  Act: The analyze_python_code method is invoked with this string.
  Assert: The feedback list includes a message about indentation errors.
Validation:
  Proper indentation is critical for the readability and correctness of Python code. This test verifies that the function can effectively identify indentation issues, helping maintain code quality.

Scenario 4: Undefined Variables in Code
Details:
  TestName: test_undefined_variable_detection
  Description: Confirm that the function can identify and report the use of undefined variables.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string of Python code that uses variables which are not defined anywhere.
  Act: The analyze_python_code method is called with this string.
  Assert: The feedback list includes messages about each undefined variable.
Validation:
  Catching undefined variables is crucial for preventing runtime errors. This test ensures that the function can detect such issues, aiding in static code analysis and debugging.

Scenario 5: Code with Style Issues According to PEP8
Details:
  TestName: test_code_style_issues
  Description: Ensure that the function can detect and report code style issues as per PEP8 guidelines.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string of Python code that violates PEP8 style guidelines.
  Act: The analyze_python_code method is used on this code.
  Assert: The feedback list includes a message regarding style issues.
Validation:
  Adhering to a style guide like PEP8 is essential for maintaining code consistency and readability. This test checks the function’s ability to enforce such standards, which is important for professional coding environments.

Scenario 6: Poorly Commented Code
Details:
  TestName: test_comment_style_issues
  Description: Test if the function can identify and provide feedback on poorly styled comments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Python code with comments that either lack a preceding space or are empty after the hash.
  Act: The analyze_python_code method is called with this string.
  Assert: The feedback list includes suggestions to improve comment styles.
Validation:
  Comments are vital for code maintainability and understanding. This test verifies that the function can guide developers to improve comment quality, which enhances code clarity and collaboration.
```

These scenarios cover a range of typical issues a Python static code analyzer might encounter, ensuring that the function is robust, user-friendly, and effective in promoting good coding practices.
