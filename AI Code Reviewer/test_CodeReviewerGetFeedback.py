Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `get_feedback` method:

**Scenario 1: Return an empty list when no feedback is provided**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_feedback_empty_list
  Description: Verify that an empty list is returned when no feedback is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class without adding any feedback.
  Act: Call the `get_feedback` method.
  Assert: Check that an empty list is returned.
Validation: This test ensures that the `get_feedback` method returns an empty list when no feedback is present, as per the business logic.

**Scenario 2: Return a populated list when feedback is provided**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_feedback_populated_list
  Description: Verify that a populated list is returned when feedback is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class and add some feedback.
  Act: Call the `get_feedback` method.
  Assert: Check that a populated list is returned, and the contents match the added feedback.
Validation: This test ensures that the `get_feedback` method returns the expected feedback when it is present, as per the business logic.

**Scenario 3: Return the same list instance on multiple calls**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_feedback_same_list_instance
  Description: Verify that the same list instance is returned on multiple calls to `get_feedback`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class and add some feedback.
  Act: Call the `get_feedback` method multiple times.
  Assert: Check that the same list instance is returned each time.
Validation: This test ensures that the `get_feedback` method returns a reference to the internal list, rather than creating a new one each time, as per the business logic.

**Scenario 4: Return a list that is not modified externally**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_feedback_list_immutable
  Description: Verify that the returned list is not modified when the external list is modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class and add some feedback.
  Act: Call the `get_feedback` method and modify the returned list.
  Assert: Check that the internal list remains unchanged.
Validation: This test ensures that the `get_feedback` method returns a copy of the internal list, or that the internal list is not modified by external changes, as per the business logic.

**Scenario 5: Return a list that is not affected by internal modifications**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_feedback_list_internal_modifications
  Description: Verify that the returned list is not affected by internal modifications.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class and add some feedback.
  Act: Call the `get_feedback` method, modify the internal list, and then call `get_feedback` again.
  Assert: Check that the returned list remains unchanged.
Validation: This test ensures that the `get_feedback` method returns a snapshot of the internal list at the time of the call, and is not affected by subsequent internal modifications, as per the business logic.

These scenarios cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions of the `get_feedback` method.
