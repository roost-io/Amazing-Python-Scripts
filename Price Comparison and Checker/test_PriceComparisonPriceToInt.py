================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components
Issue: The code uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries which may contain known vulnerabilities if outdated versions are used. This could allow attackers to exploit security holes.
Solution: Ensure the latest patched versions of requests and BeautifulSoup are installed. Consider using a tool like pip-audit or safety to check dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The priceToInt function assumes the input price contains only digits. If unexpected characters are present, it may throw exceptions or behave incorrectly.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the price input before processing. Use regular expressions to ensure only expected characters are present. Handle any exceptions gracefully.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: If the code uses the pickle module to deserialize data from an untrusted source, it can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
Solution: Avoid using pickle for deserializing untrusted data. Instead, prefer safe serialization formats like JSON. If pickle is absolutely required, sign the serialized data to detect tampering.

================================================================================
Here are the Pytest test scenarios for the provided `priceToInt` function:

Scenario 1: Valid Price String Conversion
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_price_string_conversion
  Description: This test verifies that the `priceToInt` function correctly converts a valid price string containing digits and non-digit characters to an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a valid price string with digits and non-digit characters.
  Act: Call the `priceToInt` function with the prepared price string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is an integer representing the extracted digits from the price string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function accurately extracts the numeric price value from a string that may contain additional characters. It validates that the function correctly handles the business logic of converting a price string to an integer for comparison purposes.

Scenario 2: Price String with Leading Zeros
Details:
  TestName: test_price_string_with_leading_zeros
  Description: This test verifies that the `priceToInt` function correctly handles price strings that contain leading zeros.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a price string with leading zeros followed by digits.
  Act: Call the `priceToInt` function with the prepared price string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is an integer representing the extracted digits without the leading zeros.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles price strings with leading zeros. It validates that the function removes any leading zeros and returns the correct numeric value, as leading zeros should not affect the actual price value.

Scenario 3: Price String with Only Non-Digit Characters
Details:
  TestName: test_price_string_with_only_non_digits
  Description: This test verifies that the `priceToInt` function correctly handles price strings that contain only non-digit characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a price string containing only non-digit characters.
  Act: Call the `priceToInt` function with the prepared price string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 0, as no digits were found in the price string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles the case when a price string does not contain any digits. It validates that the function returns 0 in such cases, indicating that no valid price value was found.

Scenario 4: Empty Price String
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_price_string
  Description: This test verifies that the `priceToInt` function correctly handles an empty price string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty price string.
  Act: Call the `priceToInt` function with the empty price string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 0, as no digits were found in the empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles the case when an empty price string is provided. It validates that the function returns 0 in such cases, indicating that no valid price value was found.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `priceToInt` function's business logic, including handling valid price strings, leading zeros, non-digit characters, and empty strings. They ensure that the function correctly extracts the numeric price value from the given string and returns the expected integer value for comparison purposes.
