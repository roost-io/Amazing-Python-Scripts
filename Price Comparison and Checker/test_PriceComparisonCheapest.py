================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components
Issue: The code uses the requests library which is a popular but unmaintained third-party package. Using unmaintained dependencies can introduce security vulnerabilities if they contain unpatched issues.
Solution: Switch to using a maintained library for making HTTP requests such as httpx or urllib3. Ensure dependencies are kept up-to-date and regularly check for any reported security issues.

Vulnerability: CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
Issue: The code does not properly validate or sanitize external input from web scraping. Untrusted data from parsed HTML could potentially be used in an unsafe manner leading to vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting if the data is handled improperly.
Solution: Implement strict input validation and sanitization on any external data obtained from web scraping, such as with BeautifulSoup. Escape or sanitize untrusted input before using it, especially if it gets included in SQL queries, HTML output, or passed to other functions. Consider using libraries like bleach for sanitizing HTML.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: Price and product data scraped from websites may be sensitive information. Storing or exposing this data insecurely could allow unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure any sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Implement access controls to limit exposure only to authorized users or systems. Avoid logging or storing more data than is necessary.

================================================================================
Here are the Pytest test scenarios for the provided `cheapest` function:

Scenario 1: Verify cheapest product is returned
Details:
  TestName: test_cheapest_product_returned
  Description: This test verifies that the `cheapest` function correctly returns the cheapest price from the provided list of products and prices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of products and corresponding prices.
  Act: Invoke the `cheapest` function with the prepared products, prices, and a name.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the expected cheapest price.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the `cheapest` function accurately identifies and returns the lowest price from the given list of products, aligning with the business requirement of finding the most affordable option.

Scenario 2: Verify top 5 products are printed
Details:
  TestName: test_top_five_products_printed
  Description: This test verifies that the `cheapest` function correctly prints the top 5 products sorted by price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of products and corresponding prices.
  Act: Invoke the `cheapest` function with the prepared products, prices, and a name.
  Assert: Capture the printed output and verify that it contains the expected top 5 products sorted by price.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `cheapest` function provides the user with a helpful overview of the top 5 most affordable products, enhancing the user experience and aligning with the business goal of presenting relevant information.

Scenario 3: Verify behavior with empty product list
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_product_list
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `cheapest` function when provided with an empty list of products.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty list of products and an empty list of prices.
  Act: Invoke the `cheapest` function with the empty lists and a name.
  Assert: Check that the function handles the empty input gracefully, either returning a special value or raising an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `cheapest` function can handle the edge case of an empty product list, preventing unexpected errors and providing a clear indication to the user or caller.

Scenario 4: Verify behavior with duplicate prices
Details:
  TestName: test_duplicate_prices
  Description: This test verifies that the `cheapest` function correctly handles the scenario where multiple products have the same cheapest price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of products and corresponding prices, including multiple products with the same cheapest price.
  Act: Invoke the `cheapest` function with the prepared products, prices, and a name.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the expected cheapest price and prints the top 5 products, including the duplicates.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `cheapest` function can handle the case of multiple products having the same lowest price, providing accurate results and maintaining the integrity of the top 5 products list.

Scenario 5: Verify behavior with large dataset
Details:
  TestName: test_large_dataset
  Description: This test verifies the performance and correctness of the `cheapest` function when provided with a large dataset of products and prices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large list of products and corresponding prices (e.g., 1000+ items).
  Act: Invoke the `cheapest` function with the large dataset and a name.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct cheapest price and prints the top 5 products within a reasonable time frame.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `cheapest` function can efficiently handle large datasets, providing accurate results and maintaining acceptable performance, which is essential for scalability and user satisfaction.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `cheapest` function's behavior, including expected functionality, edge cases, and performance considerations. They aim to validate the business logic encapsulated by the function and ensure its reliability and correctness.
