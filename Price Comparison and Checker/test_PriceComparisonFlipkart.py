================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'item' parameter in the flipkart() function is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in the URL construction. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious input and potentially perform HTTP header injection or XSS attacks.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques. Use a well-tested URL encoding library to safely encode the 'item' parameter before including it in the URL.

Vulnerability: CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
Issue: The code directly uses the requests library to make HTTP requests without any authentication or verification of the server's identity. This could lead to potential man-in-the-middle attacks or communication with malicious servers.
Solution: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication. Verify the server's SSL/TLS certificate to ensure its authenticity. Consider using a library like 'requests' that provides built-in support for SSL/TLS verification.

Vulnerability: CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
Issue: The code does not implement any form of secure password hashing or storage. If user credentials are involved, storing passwords in plain text or using weak hashing algorithms can lead to unauthorized access if the database is compromised.
Solution: Use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2 with a sufficient number of iterations. Store the hashed passwords instead of plain text. Additionally, consider implementing salting to prevent rainbow table attacks.

================================================================================
Here are the test scenarios for the provided `flipkart` function:

Scenario 1: Valid Item Search
Details:
  TestName: test_flipkart_valid_item_search
  Description: This test verifies that the `flipkart` function correctly retrieves the cheapest product and price for a valid search item.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` modules are properly imported and the `headers` variable is defined.
  Act: Call the `flipkart` function with a valid search item as the argument.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a tuple containing the cheapest product name, price, and the name "Flipkart".
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the core functionality of the `flipkart` function works as expected. It validates that the function can successfully scrape the Flipkart website, extract the relevant product and price information, and return the cheapest option.

Scenario 2: Empty Search Results
Details:
  TestName: test_flipkart_empty_search_results
  Description: This test verifies that the `flipkart` function handles the case when no search results are found for the given item.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` modules are properly imported and the `headers` variable is defined.
  Act: Call the `flipkart` function with a search item that is unlikely to yield any results.
  Assert: Check that the function prints the message "Flipkart search failed." to the console and returns `None`.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the `flipkart` function gracefully handles scenarios where no search results are found. It validates that the function provides appropriate feedback to the user and returns `None` to indicate the absence of results.

Scenario 3: Price Conversion
Details:
  TestName: test_flipkart_price_conversion
  Description: This test verifies that the `flipkart` function correctly converts the price string to an integer using the `priceToInt` function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` modules are properly imported and the `headers` variable is defined. Also, ensure that the `priceToInt` function is defined and available.
  Act: Call the `flipkart` function with a search item that is known to have prices with commas or other non-numeric characters.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a tuple containing the cheapest product name, price as an integer, and the name "Flipkart".
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the `flipkart` function correctly handles the price conversion using the `priceToInt` function. It validates that the function can extract the price string, remove any non-numeric characters, and convert it to an integer for accurate price comparison.

Scenario 4: Limit Search Results
Details:
  TestName: test_flipkart_limit_search_results
  Description: This test verifies that the `flipkart` function limits the number of search results to 5 products.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` modules are properly imported and the `headers` variable is defined.
  Act: Call the `flipkart` function with a search item that is known to have more than 5 search results.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a tuple containing the cheapest product name, price, and the name "Flipkart" from the first 5 search results.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the `flipkart` function adheres to the specified limit of 5 search results. It validates that the function correctly extracts and processes only the first 5 products and prices, ignoring any additional results.

Scenario 5: Cheapest Product Selection
Details:
  TestName: test_flipkart_cheapest_product_selection
  Description: This test verifies that the `flipkart` function correctly selects the cheapest product from the search results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` modules are properly imported and the `headers` variable is defined. Also, ensure that the `cheapest` function is defined and available.
  Act: Call the `flipkart` function with a search item that is known to have multiple products with different prices.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a tuple containing the product name with the lowest price, its corresponding price, and the name "Flipkart".
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the `flipkart` function accurately identifies and returns the cheapest product from the search results. It validates that the function uses the `cheapest` function correctly to compare the prices and select the product with the lowest price.

These test scenarios cover the key aspects of the `flipkart` function's business logic, including valid item search, empty search results, price conversion, limiting search results, and selecting the cheapest product. They help ensure that the function behaves as expected and handles various scenarios correctly.
