================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The affine cipher is a very weak encryption algorithm that can be easily broken using frequency analysis or brute force attacks. It provides no real security and should not be used for any sensitive data.
Solution: Use a strong, modern encryption algorithm like AES from the Python cryptography library instead of implementing weak ciphers from scratch. Ensure the encryption key is generated securely using a cryptographically secure random number generator.

Vulnerability: CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
Issue: The encryption key parameters a and b are not derived from user input or a secure key generation process. Using hard-coded keys significantly weakens the security of the encryption.
Solution: Generate the encryption key using a secure key derivation function like PBKDF2 from the Python cryptography library. The key should be derived from a user-provided password or passphrase, and a random salt should be used.

================================================================================
Here are the Pytest test scenarios for the provided `affine_cipher_encrypt` method:

Scenario 1: Encryption of lowercase alphabetic characters
Details:
  TestName: test_affine_cipher_encrypt_lowercase
  Description: This test verifies that the affine_cipher_encrypt function correctly encrypts lowercase alphabetic characters using the provided encryption parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a plaintext string containing lowercase alphabetic characters and the encryption parameters a and b.
  Act: Call the affine_cipher_encrypt function with the plaintext, a, and b as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the returned encrypted text matches the expected encrypted string.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the core functionality of the affine_cipher_encrypt function works as expected for lowercase alphabetic characters, which is a fundamental requirement of the Affine Cipher encryption.

Scenario 2: Encryption of uppercase alphabetic characters
Details:
  TestName: test_affine_cipher_encrypt_uppercase
  Description: This test verifies that the affine_cipher_encrypt function correctly encrypts uppercase alphabetic characters using the provided encryption parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a plaintext string containing uppercase alphabetic characters and the encryption parameters a and b.
  Act: Call the affine_cipher_encrypt function with the plaintext, a, and b as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the returned encrypted text matches the expected encrypted string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the affine_cipher_encrypt function handles uppercase alphabetic characters correctly, maintaining the case sensitivity of the input text.

Scenario 3: Encryption of mixed case alphabetic characters
Details:
  TestName: test_affine_cipher_encrypt_mixed_case
  Description: This test verifies that the affine_cipher_encrypt function correctly encrypts a mixture of lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters using the provided encryption parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a plaintext string containing both lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters and the encryption parameters a and b.
  Act: Call the affine_cipher_encrypt function with the plaintext, a, and b as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the returned encrypted text matches the expected encrypted string, preserving the original case of each character.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the affine_cipher_encrypt function maintains the case sensitivity of the input text when encrypting a mixture of lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters.

Scenario 4: Encryption of non-alphabetic characters
Details:
  TestName: test_affine_cipher_encrypt_non_alphabetic
  Description: This test verifies that the affine_cipher_encrypt function correctly handles non-alphabetic characters by leaving them unchanged in the encrypted text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a plaintext string containing non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation) and the encryption parameters a and b.
  Act: Call the affine_cipher_encrypt function with the plaintext, a, and b as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the returned encrypted text matches the original plaintext, with non-alphabetic characters remaining unchanged.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the affine_cipher_encrypt function does not modify non-alphabetic characters, as they are not subject to the Affine Cipher encryption process.

Scenario 5: Encryption with a = 1 (identity transformation)
Details:
  TestName: test_affine_cipher_encrypt_identity_transformation
  Description: This test verifies that the affine_cipher_encrypt function correctly encrypts the plaintext when the encryption parameter a is set to 1, resulting in an identity transformation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a plaintext string and set the encryption parameters a to 1 and b to any valid value.
  Act: Call the affine_cipher_encrypt function with the plaintext, a, and b as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the returned encrypted text matches the expected encrypted string, which should be a shifted version of the plaintext based on the value of b.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the affine_cipher_encrypt function handles the case when a = 1, which represents an identity transformation in the Affine Cipher encryption process.

Scenario 6: Encryption with empty plaintext
Details:
  TestName: test_affine_cipher_encrypt_empty_plaintext
  Description: This test verifies that the affine_cipher_encrypt function correctly handles an empty plaintext string by returning an empty encrypted text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty plaintext string and set the encryption parameters a and b to any valid values.
  Act: Call the affine_cipher_encrypt function with the empty plaintext, a, and b as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the returned encrypted text is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the affine_cipher_encrypt function handles the edge case of an empty plaintext string gracefully, returning an empty encrypted text without any errors.

These test scenarios cover the core functionality, case sensitivity, handling of non-alphabetic characters, identity transformation, and the edge case of an empty plaintext string. They provide a comprehensive set of tests to validate the business logic encapsulated by the `affine_cipher_encrypt` function.
