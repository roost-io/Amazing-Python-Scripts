================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not properly validate user input for the encryption parameters like the shift value in Caesar cipher, a and b values in Affine cipher, and the transposition key. This could allow attackers to enter invalid or malicious input leading to unintended behavior or errors.
Solution: Implement strict input validation using if conditions or regular expressions to check that the input values are within expected ranges and formats before using them. Properly handle invalid input by displaying an error message and safely exiting.

Vulnerability: CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
Issue: The substitution cipher key is read directly from user input without any encryption or protection. If an attacker gains access to the source code, they can see the key and break the encryption.
Solution: Instead of hardcoding keys in source code, store them securely outside the codebase such as in environment variables or a secrets management system. If user-supplied keys are allowed, ensure they are properly encrypted in transit and at rest.

Vulnerability: CWE-328: Reversible One-Way Hash
Issue: The encryption schemes used (Caesar, Affine, Substitution, Transposition) are weak and reversible. They do not provide adequate security and can be easily broken by attackers using frequency analysis or brute-force techniques.
Solution: Avoid implementing custom encryption schemes. Instead, use well-established, secure, and proven encryption algorithms from Python's cryptography library or other reputable third-party packages. Ensure the implementations are up-to-date and follow cryptographic best practices.

Vulnerability: CWE-656: Reliance on Security Through Obscurity
Issue: The encryption logic is exposed in plain text within the source code. An attacker with access to the source code can study the encryption algorithms and find weaknesses to break the encryption.
Solution: Do not rely on hiding source code as a security measure. Assume the attacker has knowledge of the algorithms. Use secure, well-vetted encryption schemes and protect sensitive data like keys separately. Consider compiling to bytecode and obfuscating to make reverse engineering harder.
