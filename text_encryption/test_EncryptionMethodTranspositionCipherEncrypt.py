================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'key' parameter is not validated before being used in the 'int()' function and as the range for the 'for' loop. This could lead to ValueError exceptions if non-integer values are provided, or unexpected behavior if negative or very large values are used.
Solution: Validate the 'key' parameter to ensure it is a positive integer within an acceptable range before using it in the 'int()' function and the 'for' loop.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The transposition cipher is a weak form of encryption and should not be used for sensitive data. The ciphertext can be easily decrypted if the key is known or guessed.
Solution: Use a strong, modern encryption algorithm from the Python standard library or a reputable third-party library, such as AES from the 'cryptography' package, to encrypt sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The transposition cipher is a simple substitution cipher that is easily broken using frequency analysis or other cryptanalytic techniques. It does not provide adequate security for protecting sensitive information.
Solution: Replace the transposition cipher with a secure, well-established encryption algorithm, such as AES, RSA, or ChaCha20, using a trusted implementation from the Python standard library or a reputable third-party package.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Encryption
Details:
  TestName: test_transposition_cipher_encrypt_valid_input
  Description: This test verifies that the transposition_cipher_encrypt function correctly encrypts a given text using a valid key.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a sample text and a valid key.
  Act: Call the transposition_cipher_encrypt function with the sample text and key.
  Assert: Check that the returned ciphertext matches the expected encrypted output.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the encryption process works as intended when provided with valid input. It confirms that the function correctly rearranges the characters based on the given key, producing the expected ciphertext.

Scenario 2: Empty Text
Details:
  TestName: test_transposition_cipher_encrypt_empty_text
  Description: This test verifies that the transposition_cipher_encrypt function handles an empty text input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty string as the text input and a valid key.
  Act: Call the transposition_cipher_encrypt function with the empty text and key.
  Assert: Check that the returned ciphertext is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function does not break or produce unexpected results when given an empty text input. It validates that the function handles this edge case correctly and returns an empty ciphertext.

Scenario 3: Single Character Text
Details:
  TestName: test_transposition_cipher_encrypt_single_character_text
  Description: This test verifies that the transposition_cipher_encrypt function correctly encrypts a single-character text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a single-character text and a valid key.
  Act: Call the transposition_cipher_encrypt function with the single-character text and key.
  Assert: Check that the returned ciphertext matches the expected single-character output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the encryption process works correctly even for a single-character text. It validates that the function handles this edge case and produces the expected ciphertext.

Scenario 4: Key Larger Than Text Length
Details:
  TestName: test_transposition_cipher_encrypt_key_larger_than_text
  Description: This test verifies that the transposition_cipher_encrypt function handles a key that is larger than the length of the text input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a sample text and a key that is larger than the text length.
  Act: Call the transposition_cipher_encrypt function with the sample text and large key.
  Assert: Check that the returned ciphertext matches the expected encrypted output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the key is larger than the text length. It validates that the encryption process still produces the expected ciphertext without any errors or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 5: Key Equal to Text Length
Details:
  TestName: test_transposition_cipher_encrypt_key_equal_to_text_length
  Description: This test verifies that the transposition_cipher_encrypt function correctly encrypts the text when the key is equal to the length of the text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a sample text and a key that is equal to the text length.
  Act: Call the transposition_cipher_encrypt function with the sample text and key.
  Assert: Check that the returned ciphertext matches the expected encrypted output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the encryption process works correctly when the key length is equal to the text length. It validates that the function produces the expected ciphertext without any errors or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 6: Key Equal to One
Details:
  TestName: test_transposition_cipher_encrypt_key_equal_to_one
  Description: This test verifies that the transposition_cipher_encrypt function correctly encrypts the text when the key is equal to one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a sample text and a key equal to one.
  Act: Call the transposition_cipher_encrypt function with the sample text and key.
  Assert: Check that the returned ciphertext matches the original text.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the encryption process works correctly when the key is equal to one. It validates that the function returns the original text as the ciphertext, as no transposition occurs in this case.
