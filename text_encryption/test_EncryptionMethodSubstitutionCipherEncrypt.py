================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The substitution cipher used for encryption is a weak cryptographic algorithm that can be easily broken using frequency analysis or other techniques. It does not provide adequate security for sensitive data.
Solution: Use a strong, modern encryption algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) from the `cryptography` library instead of implementing a custom substitution cipher. Ensure that the encryption key is securely generated and managed.

Vulnerability: CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
Issue: The encryption key is passed as a parameter to the `substitution_cipher_encrypt` function, which suggests that it might be hard-coded or stored insecurely. Hard-coded keys can be easily discovered by attackers, compromising the security of the encrypted data.
Solution: Instead of passing the encryption key as a parameter, retrieve it securely from a trusted source, such as a key management system or a secure configuration file. Ensure that the key is not stored in plain text and is properly protected.

Vulnerability: CWE-1204: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
Issue: The code does not include any error handling or logging mechanisms. If an exception occurs during the encryption process, it may reveal sensitive information about the input data or the encryption key in the error message or traceback.
Solution: Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Use the `logging` module to log errors and ensure that logs are stored securely and accessible only to authorized personnel.

================================================================================
Here are the Pytest test scenarios for the provided `substitution_cipher_encrypt` method:

Scenario 1: Encrypting a text with a valid substitution key
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_with_valid_key
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly encrypts a given text using a valid substitution key, replacing each letter with its corresponding substitution while preserving case and non-alphabetic characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a sample text and a valid substitution key.
  Act: Call the `substitution_cipher_encrypt` function with the sample text and key.
  Assert: Check that the returned encrypted text matches the expected encrypted text.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the core functionality of the substitution cipher encryption works as intended. It validates that the function correctly applies the substitution key to each letter in the text, maintaining the case and leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

Scenario 2: Encrypting an empty text
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_empty_text
  Description: This test verifies that the function handles the case of encrypting an empty text, ensuring that it returns an empty string without any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty string as the input text and a valid substitution key.
  Act: Call the `substitution_cipher_encrypt` function with the empty text and key.
  Assert: Check that the returned encrypted text is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test covers the edge case of encrypting an empty text. It ensures that the function gracefully handles this scenario and returns an empty string, preventing any unexpected behavior or errors.

Scenario 3: Encrypting a text with only non-alphabetic characters
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_non_alphabetic_text
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a text containing only non-alphabetic characters, ensuring that the original text is returned unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a sample text containing only non-alphabetic characters and a valid substitution key.
  Act: Call the `substitution_cipher_encrypt` function with the non-alphabetic text and key.
  Assert: Check that the returned encrypted text is the same as the original text.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly identifies and skips non-alphabetic characters during the encryption process. It ensures that the function does not attempt to substitute or modify non-alphabetic characters, preserving their original form in the encrypted text.

Scenario 4: Encrypting a text with a substitution key containing repeated characters
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_with_repeated_key_chars
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly encrypts a text using a substitution key that contains repeated characters, ensuring that the repeated characters in the key do not affect the encryption process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a sample text and a substitution key with repeated characters.
  Act: Call the `substitution_cipher_encrypt` function with the sample text and the key with repeated characters.
  Assert: Check that the returned encrypted text matches the expected encrypted text.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles substitution keys with repeated characters correctly. It validates that the repeated characters in the key do not introduce any ambiguity or errors in the encryption process and that the function still applies the substitution consistently.

Scenario 5: Encrypting a text with a substitution key of a different length than the alphabet
Details:
  TestName: test_encrypt_with_invalid_key_length
  Description: This test verifies that the function raises an appropriate exception when provided with a substitution key whose length does not match the length of the alphabet.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a sample text and a substitution key with a length different from the alphabet.
  Act: Call the `substitution_cipher_encrypt` function with the sample text and the invalid key.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function properly handles the case when the provided substitution key has a length different from the alphabet. It ensures that the function detects this invalid key length and raises a `ValueError` to indicate the error, preventing the encryption process from proceeding with an invalid key.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `substitution_cipher_encrypt` function's business logic, including expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions. They ensure that the function correctly encrypts the text using the provided substitution key, handles empty and non-alphabetic texts, deals with repeated characters in the key, and raises appropriate exceptions for invalid key lengths.
